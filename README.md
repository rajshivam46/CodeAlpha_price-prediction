# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Random Forest

This project predicts the **selling price** of used cars using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset containing various car features and applies a Random Forest Regressor model for prediction.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is loaded from a ZIP file (`archive (1).zip`) and contains the following columns:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacturing
- `Selling_Price`: Selling price (target variable)
- `Present_Price`: Current ex-showroom price
- `Kms_Driven`: Distance driven in kilometers
- `Fuel_Type`: Type of fuel used (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- `Seller_Type`: Type of seller (Dealer/Individual)
- `Transmission`: Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners

## 🎯 Objective

To train a regression model that predicts `Selling_Price` based on car features using **RandomForestReg
